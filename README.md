# NS+
NS+ is a [Neurosynth](www.neurosynth.org)-based tool with additional meta-analysis functions and a graphical user interface, which supports highly customizable forward and reverse inference analyses within any given region of interest.

Some of the things you could do with NS+:
- Rank 3000+ terms (e.g. "social", "emotion", "working memory") in any ROI, to explore what brain functions the ROI is responsible for
- Compare multiple terms (battle royale!) and get a map that shows the territory where each term dominates in an ROI
- Analyze, compare or rank custom terms in addition to existing terms in Neurosynth
- ... and more functionalities in development!

## Installation
You can now download a beta version for MacOS [here](https://github.com/MetaD/NSplus/releases). No need to install anything -- just unzip it and start to use.

For advanced users, you could alternatively use NS+ as a Python package, and run analyses in Python instead of using the GUI. To install NS+ (beta) with pip: `pip install git+https://github.com/MetaD/NSplus.git`
